Create collection named ’ArraySet’. It must contain only unique elements, inside storage must be done using an array, for expanding use native methods from class System.
Implement ability to iterate through elements using ‘foreach’ construction. If your collection is modifying without iterator, throw ConcurrentModificationException (yes, that means you need to implement ‘iterator()’).
